# fractol

**You will need to download the [`libs`](https://github.com/cquillet/libs) project in the same directory you will clone `fractol` to run it**

This is a program to draw fractals

*usage:* `fractol (mandel[brot] | julia | burning | newton)`

Available fractals/sets are :
* Madelbrot
* Julia : can be animated by moving the mouse (`space bar` to play/pause), you can change the power of the formula with the keys `[` and `]`
* Burning ship
* Newton : you can change the polynomials used with the keys `[` and `]`

You can draw a box (*click and drag*) in order to zoom in (*left click*) or out (*right click*) 

Press `H` to show a little help


#### Example of the zoombox in Julia set:
